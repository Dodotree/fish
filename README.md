# fish
 
Fish is a wrapper engine around Watir.

Web automations ('plays') are expressed in YAML files.
Designed to be minimalistic, extendable, polyglot.
Influenced by Squish (by FrogLogic) and Ansible.
License is BSD.


The combination I use is:

- Windows: "Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter"
- Ruby 2.2.5 (http://rubyinstaller.org)
- Watir (gem install watir)
- Google chrome ( MS IE )
- Perl 5 version 24 (http://www.activestate.com/activeperl)
